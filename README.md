# IPCrypt Implementation in COBOL

[IPCrypt](https://ipcrypt-std.github.io/) is an open specification for encrypting and obfuscating IP addresses. It provides cryptographically secure, reversible encryption that allows organizations to protect user privacy while maintaining network operational capabilities like analytics and rate limiting on encrypted addresses.

This repository provides a complete implementation of the IPCrypt specification in COBOL.
